### Publishing **Map Stories**

*Maps are a powerful way to document cultural knowledge. By mapping just place names alone, you can start to create an archive of traditional, ecological, and historical knowledge. But as many community mappers have discovered, once you start mapping place names and want to sit down with an elder to ask about the locations of places, the stories start to flow, and you realize that the place names are just the tip of the iceberg.
